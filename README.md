Hello! I am `Mike Rombout`, and I'm a Software Engineer building microservices at Philips HealthSuite digital platform.

* ⛅ I'm interested in cloud native and cloud agnostic software solutions.
* 🐹 And building beautiful software in Go, but I don't mind a bit of ♨️ either.
* 📚 For fun I like to read _and_ write novels, games and interactive fiction.
* 🥾 To relax, I like to be outside enjoying nature 🇳🇴🇸🇪🇫🇮.
